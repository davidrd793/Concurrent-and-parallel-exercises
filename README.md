# Concurrent-and-parallel-exercises
A collection of resources focused on Concurrent and Parallel Computing from a beginner friendly perspective. 

# What is included in this repository?
This repository is meant to be an accesible tool to learn and understand the basics of Parallel and Concurrent Computing, including:
- Theory-focused documents in markdown format (Obsidian recommended).
- Both finished code as well as unfinished code to practice the concepts.
- Exercise proposals to ensure that the expected level of proficiency on key aspects of the discipline.

# What techonologies/libraries/APIs is this repository going to focus on?
This repository will include 3 differents approachs of Parallel and Concurrent Computing technologies:
- Java Threads
- MPI on Python
- NVIDIA CUDA on Python

This implies that, in order to experience the full "course", besides having a CPU with enough compute capability to do Concurrent Computing (duh), it's almost mandatory to have an NVidia GPU for the last part of the repository (there is actually a way to avoid this requirement, which involves coding in Google Colaboratory, but we arent pretty fond of what it involves) (we're sorry)

# Final message: Thank u!
This is a work-in-progress with a lot of progress left and almost not work at all, but we hope someone will find this helpful one day, so we are glad to help you if thats your case!
